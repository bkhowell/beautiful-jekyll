A paper I have been working on for years with Travis Hagey and Kristin Winchell was recently published in the Journal of Integrative Organismal Biology. The paper has 
already been summarized by myself and Kristin for a blog she co-runs about urban evolution called [Life in the City] (https://urbanevolution-litc.com/), so I won't bore 
you with rehashing it here. If you're interested, check out the [paper] (https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/4/1/obac028/6638989) and [blogpost] 
(https://urbanevolution-litc.com/2022/07/27/cityshape-how-urban-environments-have-shaped-the-toes-of-puerto-rican-crested-anoles/) to learn more.
