A project which I was involved in at Auburn University in 2019 as an REU student recently came to fruition. Amanda Clark, Tonia Schwartz, Alan Wilson, and myself published a paper in G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics where we performed reference-guided assembly for two strains of _Daphnia pulicaria_ using _Daphnia pulex_ as a reference. This work was one of my first experiences in research as an undergraduate, and I was incredibly excited about the project since the two strains of were adapted to different conditions, one being Microcystis-resistant and one being Microcystis-sensitive. This was my first experience attempting to characterize genomic divergence driven by environmental conditions. Microcystins are toxins that are produced during toxic algal blooms, and these algal blooms are often human-induced due to agricultural practices. This work increased my interest in human-induced evolution (whether genomic, morphological, physiological, etc.), and I am very excited for you all to be able to read the full journal article (my first publication)!
